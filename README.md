# Windows-Filtering-Platform-example

Example of use of the Windows Filtering Platform API to block outbound network communication of a given process.

Useful to stop EDR and SIEM agents from sending information to their respectives C2s.

Credits to https://github.com/netero1010/EDRSilencer for giving me the idea of doing it myself after finding his repo.

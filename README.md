# -Windows-Filtering-Platform-example

Example of use of the windows API of Windows Filtering Platform to block outbound network communication of a given process.

Useful to stop EDR and SIEM agents from sending any information over the network.

Credits to https://github.com/netero1010/EDRSilencer for giving me the idea of doing it myself after finding his repo.
